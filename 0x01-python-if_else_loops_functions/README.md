# if/else. lopps and functions
This project was the second project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX School**. It aims at teaching us about if/else, loops and functions in **Python**

## Tasks and their description
Task 0 - Prints whether the number stored in the variable number is positive or negative.
Task 1 - Prints the last digit of the number stored in the variable number

Task 3 - A program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase except q and e, not followed by a new line.
Task 4 - A program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal.
Task 5 - A program that prints numbers from 0 to 99.
Task 6 - A program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.
Task 7 - A function that checks for lowercase character.
Task 8 - A function that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line.
Task 9 - A function that prints the last digit of a number.
Task 10 - A function that adds two integers and returns the result.
Task 11- A function that computes a to the power of b and return the value.
Task 12 - A unction that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space.
