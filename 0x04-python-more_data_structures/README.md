# More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

The fourth project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **Holberton School**. It aims to learn about sets, dictionaries and functions to handle data structures like lambda, map, reduce and filter in **Python**.

Tasks and their escription

Task 0 - Function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix
Task 1 - Function that replaces all occurrences of an element by another in a new list
Task 2 - Function that adds all unique integers in a list
Task 3 - Function that returns a set of common elements in two sets
Task 4 - Function that returns a set of all elements present in only one set
Task 5 - Function that returns the number of keys in a dictionary
Task 6 - Function that prints a dictionary by ordered keys
Task 7 - Function that replaces or adds key/value in a dictionary
Task 8 - Function that deletes a key in a dictionary
Task 9 - Function that returns a new dictionary with all values multiplied by 2
Task 10 - Function that returns a key with the biggest integer value
Task 11 - Function that returns a list with all values multiplied by a number without using loops
Task 12 - Function that converts a Roman number to an integer
Task 13 - Function that returns the weighted average of all integers tuple
Task 14 - Function that computes the square value of all integers of a marix using `map` |
Task 15 - Function that deletes keys with a specific value in a dictionary
Task 16 - A C functions that print some basic info about Python lists and Python bytes object
