# Test-driven development

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **Holberton School**. It aims to learn about docstrings to create and implement tests in **Python**.


Tasks and their description
Tadk 0 - Function that adds two integers (Doctest on `tests/0-add_integer.txt`)
Task 1 - Function that divides all elemtns of a matrix (Doctest on `tests/2-matrix_divided.txt`)
Task 2 - Function that prints `My name is <first name> <last name>` (Doctest on `tests/3-say_my_name.txt`)
Task 3 - Function that prints a square with the character `#` (Doctest on `tests/4-print_sqaure.txt`)
Task 4 - Function that prints a text with 2 new lines after each of these `.`, `?` and `:` (Doctest on `tests/5-text_indentation.txt`)
Task 5 - Unittests for the function `def max_integer(list=[])`
Task 6 - Function that multiplies 2 matrices (Doctest on `tests/100-matrix_mul.txt`)
Task 7 - Function that multiplies 2 matrices by using the module **NumPy** (Doctest on `tests/101-lazy_matrix_mul.txt`)
